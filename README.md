                                                              npm i --save passport 
                                                              npm i --save passport-google-oauth20 
                                                              npm i --save ejs
  ```

  
  

  Note : Chances are you will go through an error as "401. Thatâ€™s an error. Error: invalid_client The OAuth client was not found" 
  solution : Check your dotenv (.env) file and make sure there would be no comma or semicolon there at the end of any line.
